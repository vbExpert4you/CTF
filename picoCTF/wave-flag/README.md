# Wave a Flag
Can you invoke help flags for a tool or binary? This program has extraordinarily helpful information...

Downloaded the file and ran this command:
sudo chmod +x warm

Ran the file
./warm

Told me to use a -h flag so I ran

./warm -h

Oh, help? I actually don't do much, but I do have this flag here: picoCTF{b1scu1ts_4nd_gr4vy_f0668f62}
