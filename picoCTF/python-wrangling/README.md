# Python Wrangling
Python scripts are invoked kind of like programs in the Terminal... Can you run this Python script using this password to get the flag?

Opened a terminal and ran the following command:
python3 ende.py -d flag.txt.en 
When asked for the password I gave it password:ac9bd0ffac9bd0ffac9bd0ffac9bd0ff
Program spit out picoCTF{4p0110_1n_7h3_h0us3_ac9bd0ff}
